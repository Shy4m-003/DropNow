# DropNow â€“ Everyone's Taxi

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot (SQL)
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Database**: SQL (Not PostgreSQL)
- **Additional Tools**: Swagger, Actuators, CRUD Operations, REST API

## About the Project
**DropNow** is my first major project and a significant milestone in my development journey. It allowed me to dive deep into **Spring Boot** and really understand its core features. I implemented essential functionalities like:

- **Swagger** for seamless API documentation
- **Actuators** for monitoring and management
- **CRUD operations** to handle basic data manipulations
- **REST APIs** for communication between the backend and frontend

The backend is powered by **SQL**, and although I didn't use JWT here, it was an excellent way to focus on the foundational aspects of Spring Boot.

The frontend is built with **Angular**, providing an intuitive and interactive user experience to complement the backend functionality.

## Key Learnings
- Mastering **Spring Boot fundamentals**, including **Actuators**, **Swagger**, **CRUD operations**, and **REST APIs**.
- Building full-stack applications with **Angular** for a smooth user interface.
- Managing databases using **SQL** (without PostgreSQL).
  
## Impact
This project has played a crucial role in deepening my understanding of **Spring Boot** and **full-stack development**. It has laid a solid foundation for my future projects, and Iâ€™m excited to continue growing. My next project is going to be a blast, so stay tuned! ðŸ˜Ž
